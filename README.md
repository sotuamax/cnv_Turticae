# Copy number variation for the two-spotted spider mites (T. urticae)

This pipeline was developed for estimating the copy nubmer variation of genes (only transcribed region of interest)
To start, you need to prepare the following files:
1. Reference genome in fasta format
2. GFF annotation for the reference (sorted and indexed)
3. DNA-seq alignment in BAM format (sorted and indexed)
